# University-Graduates-Data-Hub
A full-stack web application that holds hypothetical data of Canadian university graduates. The goal of this project is to create a platform where post-grad students can gain a better understanding of how they match up to the current job market.

Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, js frameworks (TBD), Python, PostgreSQL

To connect to database (hosted on AWS): psql --host=database-1.c4b1rigueer1.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password --dbname=psqldb

# Current Status

Database = populated

Checking response times of some example queries (I.e return list of universities student hiring rate from best to worst...etc.)
