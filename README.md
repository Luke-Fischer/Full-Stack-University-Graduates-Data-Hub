# University-Graduates-Data-Hub
A full-stack web application that holds hypothetical data of Canadian university graduates. The goal of this project is to create a platform where (if given real data) post-grad students can gain a better understanding of how they match up to the current job market.

Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS, React, Python, PostgreSQL

Hosting: Heroku

To connect to database (hosted on AWS): psql --host=database-1.c4b1rigueer1.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password --dbname=psqldb

# Current Status

Database is populated and back end generic queries are complete. Beginning work on hosting and front-end dev.
